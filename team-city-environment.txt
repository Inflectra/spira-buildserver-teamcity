We have an on-premise installation of TeamCity on:

VM-WIN2012

You need to start the TeamCity service in Windows services, then access it using:

http://vm-win2012:88/

The login is:

Login: teamcity
Password: teamcity


The Eclipse Java environment is here:

C:\Users\bruno.gruber\Documents\eclipse\eclipse

(that is where Eclipse is actually installed)

If you ever forget the TeamCity admin password, use this - http://javahonk.com/teamcity-forgotten-admin-password/
